# Front-end-Developer-Fintech-Central-London-Up-to-80-000

This one's a cool one! Tech driven environment, flexible working, all with the aim of helping others the best they can.

This is a front-end role working with a well-known fintech start-up based in Central London on the Central line. You'll have the chance to work across a variety of tech with a really talented team, building products and platforms using both AngularJS and React.

So what are you building?

The main products are all working around a lending platform to allow small business to grow - going against the classic, rigid slow processes offered by most commercial banks. Using great tech, this company is offering the best, fastest and most flexible platform for loans.

In terms of what they're looking for, they need someone with a classic front-end developer profile, weighted towards JavaScript. They build their internal tools with AngularJS and their customer facing applications with React, but are primarily looking for someone with experience with ES6 and frameworks in general - the predominant work would be React facing and are making a general shift over to a whole React ecosystem. Experience with any bundlers is helpful, as you'll be expected to use tools such as Webpack and Lodash on a regular basis. An understanding of testing across the board would be helpful, as they use testing frameworks such as Jasmine, Mocha, Nightwatch and Enzyme, but an understanding of TDD is more important than commercial usage. As well as this, you'll be expected to have great knowledge of CSS as well as SASS/LESS and HTML.

Although this role is great, you're not going to do it for free. So what are they offering?

- Up to £80,000 dependent on experience
- Tickets to tech conferences around Europe
- Drinks and snacks in the office
- 26 days holiday including one for your birthday
- Winter and summer retreats to go and work remotely from
